						Jake; a brief synopsis
					</h3>
					<img src="http://jhwebdev.com/assets/images/me.jpg">

					<p>
						I have been working in front-end development for around 3.5 years now. When designing a new project I put myself in the shoes
						of the end user and I build the best project I can for them. I think of different ways they might use the app and try
						to find the best solutions for them.
						<br>
						<br> In March of 2018 I was certified as a Full-Stack developer from the University of Utah. In addition I also won
						best UI/UX for the <a href="www.studentcrashpads.com" target="_blank">Student Crash Pads</a> housing finder app.
						<br>
						<br> I love trying new things in development and I am not afraid of making mistakes because that is how we learn and
						improve ourselves and others.

						<strong>Pharmatech</strong><br>
						I was with Pharmatech since Early 2015 through mid-2018. Pharmatech provides back office solutions for network marketing
						companies of all sizes. These solutions include Enrolling new distributors, Allowing for placing of orders, along with
						checking commissions.
						<br>

						<h4>Selected Contributions</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A full rebuild of the account settings page, rendering the page 50% faster and much more user friendly</li>
							<li>Enabled distributors to download invoices for a full calendar year for taxes. The way this was built enables this
								ability for an infinite amount of time to come without having to update the code </li>
							<li>Overseeing the inputing of translations for our global site. While overseeing translations I was able to make
								the site 98% translated, minus any new builds that were in production or just released, as well as improving the
								quality of translations</li>

					<p>
						I come from a hard-working background and I always do whatever it takes to accomplish the task at hand. If I don't know how
						to do it, I figure it out. I have never missed a deadline on a project that was within my control, and I always provide
						a can-do attitude when any new project comes up.
